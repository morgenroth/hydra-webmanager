Hydra Download Directory
========================

This folder is used to deploy files to all the slaves. This includes OpenWrt
**image** files as well as **session** configurations.

------

#### OpenWrt Images

To run a Hydra session the slaves need an image file as base to prepare individual
instances of nodes. Adding new images is a manual procedure. You need to download
and place OpenWrt image files into the `dl` folder before running any sessions.

OpenWrt image files are available on the [download site of
OpenWrt](http://downloads.openwrt.org/). For the `attitude adjustment` release
you can download the [openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext4.img.gz](http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/x86/generic/openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext4.img.gz) image.
